# Covvest


Covvest is designed to be a investment platform for real estate. We work together with house rental company who want to raise fund to buy new property as their business asset. We tokenizing it with blockchain and allow people to buy the token as shared ownership to the asset. 

People can buy token as they wish, they can enjoy the profit sharing from the operator on periodical basis from the rental charges, and get their investment back proportionally when the asset is liquidated.
